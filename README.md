## Link to data
Download the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pwGrCrb1O08Dfh1MkFf5XSxRnIIehMf0?usp=sharing) and make a folder called "data", where the data should be copied too. (If the folder is not named "data", you should change the pathing to the data files in [config/setup.yaml](config/setup.yaml)).
